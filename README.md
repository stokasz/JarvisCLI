## Jarvis v0.1
Jarvis is the simple shell script to interact with ChatGPT through the command line. 

### Future plan for Jarvis v0.2

In the future, I plan to create a more advanced system, which for every prompt, outputs you responses from four/five different LLMs: ChatGPT frontier model, Claude's, Grok, Mistral, and Lama400b. This will be done once these are available with APIs.
